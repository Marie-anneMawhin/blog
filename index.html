<h1>Hello and welcome to my blog!</h1>
<div class="post-content">
  <p>Most of my posts are made with biological data, to give confidence to my fellow biologists to pursue their exploration of machine learning.</p> 
  <p>If you're not a biologist, don't be scared. Biological data is like any other data: you need to clean them, visualise them and model them!</p>
  <p>I hope this blog will be a useful tool for other data scientists and biologists alike!</p>
