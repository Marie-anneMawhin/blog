## A little about me.

### Hello and welcome to my blog!

I'm a **biologist and neophyte data scientist**. I have been exploring the world of **machine learning** and **deep learning** and I want to share my understanding of these models with you. I hope I can provide you with a **accurate and simple insight of AI**. Most of my post are made with biological data, to give confidence to my fellow biologist to pursue their exploration of machine learning. If you're not a biologist, don't be scared. Biological are like every data: you need to clean them, visualise them and model them! I hope this blog will be a useful tool for other data scientists.

You can check out my CV and find out more about what I'm up to right now [here](https://marie-annemawhin.github.io/).
