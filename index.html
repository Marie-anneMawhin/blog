# Hello and welcome to my blog!

Most of my posts are made with biological data, to give confidence to my fellow biologists to pursue their exploration of machine learning. If you're not a biologist, don't be scared. Biological data is like any other data: you need to clean them, visualise them and model them! I hope this blog will be a useful tool for other data scientists and biologists alike!
