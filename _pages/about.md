I'm a **biologist and neophyte data scientist**. I have been exploring the world of **machine learning** and **deep learning** and I want to share my understanding of these models with you. I hope I can provide you with an **accurate and simple insight into AI**.

You can check out my CV and find out more about what I'm up to right now **[here](https://marie-annemawhin.github.io/).**
